<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Is it `new_name = old_name`? Or was it `old_name = new_name`? Never have to remember again, and use the `switchup` addin to toggle the values before and after a `=`. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of switchup like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("daranzolin/switchup")
```

## Example

In the example below, I've set the switchup addin to Ctrl+Shift+L:

## Limitations

* The `before = after` must be on its own line. This reflects my own preference.
* Doesn't work with `==`.
